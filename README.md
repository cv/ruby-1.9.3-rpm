# What is this spec?

Forked from imeyer's ruby-1.9.2-rpm project at https://github.com/imeyer/ruby-1.9.2-rpm and updated for 1.9.3.

This spec is an attempt to push for a stable replacement of Ruby 1.8.x with 1.9.2+ on RHEL based systems. The original author based it off of the work of [FrameOS](http://www.frameos.org) specs for Ruby 1.9.2 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.

### How to install

#### CentOS 6.4

Take a look at the provisioning script in the Vagrantfile.

### What it does

+ Builds
+ Installs
+ Overwrites/upgrades your currently installed ruby package (**DANGEROUS**)
+ Includes rubygems

### What it does **not** do

+ Split packages into ruby-libs, ruby-devel, etc (looking for help here)
+ Install alongside Ruby 1.8.x

### Distro support

Tested upstream working on:

* RHEL 5.6 x86_64
* RHEL 6 x86_64
* RHEL 6.1 x86_64
* RHEL 6.1 i686
* CentOS 5.6 x86_64
* CentOS 6.4 x86_64

* I (lnxchk) have some pre-built rpms for aws amis as of 2011.09 release at http://treble.rwe40.net:8088/amzn
